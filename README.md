"About Myself"
~~~
Hi! My name is [Lincoln]. I'm someone who loves discovering new things and having fun with my hobbies. One of my favorite things to do is [drawing, singing, playing games, reading books/AU, etc.]. It helps me relax and express myself.
~~~
When it comes to music, I love listening to [My favorite: K-pop (blackpink,babymonster,enhypen, BTS, Taylor swift, olivia rodrigo etc.]. Music always makes me feel better, especially when I’m stressed or tired and sad hehe.
~~~
I also enjoy spending time with my friends and family. They make me laugh and support me in everything I do. I’m a bit shy at first, but once I get comfortable, I can be really talkative and fun to be with!
~~~
My dream is to become [your dream job—example: a nurse, and an artist, etc.], because I want to help people and do something meaningful with my life.
~~~
In my free time, I like to [—watch movies, write stories, dance, cook, etc.]. I also enjoy learning new things, whether it's a fun fact or a new skill!
~~~
One of my favorite Hobbies 
[listening to music, watching K-dramas, journaling, playing mobile games, etc.]—. I could spend hours doing it without even noticing the time. It helps me relax and also gives me a way to express my feelings when words don’t work. I also enjoy 
—basically anything that brings me peace or joy!
-I’m also a person who values friendship and good vibes. I may look quiet at first, but once I get comfortable, you’ll probably wish I had a mute button (kidding… maybe). I love laughing, joking around, and making memories with people who make me feel safe and seen.
That’s just a little glimpse of who I am—but I’m always growing, learning, and trying to be the best version of me. So if you ever want to get to know me better, just talk to me… I’m probably chillin’ somewhere with my earphones on and a snack in hand.
